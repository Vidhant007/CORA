## 🤖 How It Works

Just ask CORA a question, and she’ll take care of the rest! 💫  
CORA uses **Microsoft Autogen**, a multi-agent conversation framework, to understand and process your cloud-related queries. CORA relies on pre-defined scripts and **Terraform templates** to fetch real-time data and provide accurate responses from your cloud environments. Whether it's AWS, Azure, or GCP, CORA speaks your cloud language! 🌍

## ⚠️ Security & Prompt Jacking Protection

To ensure the security of your cloud accounts and avoid **prompt jacking**, CORA is restricted to **GET/READ** requests only. This means that CORA **cannot create, modify, or delete resources**, protecting your infrastructure from unintended actions. However, if desired, it is possible to provide CORA with the ability to perform **write** operations, but we highly recommend keeping the default read-only permissions for maximum safety.

CORA works best with **GPT-4o-mini** and **GPT-4o** models, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy in handling your cloud operations. 🚀
